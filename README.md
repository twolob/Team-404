Data Pipeline Architecture
This diagram outlines the flow of data from collection to prediction and interaction through a web interface. The architecture is composed of the following key stages:

1. Data Collection
Data is sourced from various input streams such as:
REST APIs: External services providing structured data.
Social Media: Unstructured or semi-structured data from platforms like Twitter or Facebook.
Utility Providers: Systems generating data like electricity usage or water consumption.
Location Data: Geospatial data from GPS or similar sources.
Traditional Data: Data from static sources, such as flat files or legacy databases.
All collected data is sent through a Data Ingestion mechanism for further processing.
2. Data Ingestion
Ingested data is processed using Kafka/Event Streaming to enable real-time data flow and management, ensuring seamless data transfer to downstream components.
3. Processing
Spark Processing: The data is cleaned, transformed, and aggregated using Apache Spark, a distributed processing system.
Feature Engineering: Key features are extracted or engineered from the processed data for machine learning tasks.
Database Storage: Processed data is stored in MongoDB or MySQL, depending on the use case (NoSQL for unstructured data, SQL for structured data).
4. Machine Learning Pipeline
Model Training: Machine learning models are trained using Python-based frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch on the processed data.
Model Deployment: Trained models are deployed in a production environment to handle real-time predictions.
Real-time Prediction: The deployed model predicts outcomes based on new incoming data.
5. API Layer
A REST API is used to expose predictions and processed data to external systems.
The Web Interface serves as the front end, allowing users to interact with the system and visualize predictions or other outputs in real time.
